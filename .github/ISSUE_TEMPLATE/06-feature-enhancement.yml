        ### ü§ñ For Copilot Agent
        
        **Implementation Guidelines:**
        - Analyze the feature requirements and determine the best approach
        - Consider which files need modification based on feature type:
          - Backend API: `src/backend/routers/` (new endpoints if needed)
          - Frontend UI: `src/static/` files for new interface elements
          - Database: `src/backend/database.py` for new data structures
          - Static assets: New CSS/JavaScript for feature functionality
        - Break down complex features into smaller, manageable components
        - Ensure new feature integrates well with existing codebase
        - Follow existing code patterns and conventions
        - Consider error handling and edge cases
        - Test feature thoroughly with various scenarios
        
        **Development Approach:**
        1. Analyze requirements and create implementation plan
        2. Design any necessary API endpoints or data structures
        3. Implement backend functionality if needed
        4. Create or modify frontend components
        5. Add appropriate styling and user interaction
        6. Test feature with various use cases
