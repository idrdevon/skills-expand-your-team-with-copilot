        ### ü§ñ For Copilot Agent
        
        **Investigation Guidelines:**
        - Review the reported steps and try to reproduce the issue
        - Check relevant code areas based on the bug category:
          - Authentication: `src/backend/routers/auth.py`
          - Registration: `src/backend/routers/activities.py` (signup/unregister endpoints)
          - Display: Frontend files in `src/static/`
          - Database: `src/backend/database.py`
        - Look for common issues like:
          - Input validation problems
          - Error handling gaps
          - Race conditions in concurrent operations
          - Frontend/backend data format mismatches
        - Create test cases to verify the fix
        - Ensure fix doesn't break other functionality
        
        **Acceptance Criteria:**
        - [ ] Issue can be reproduced following the reported steps
        - [ ] Root cause is identified and documented
        - [ ] Fix is implemented with minimal code changes
        - [ ] Fix is tested and verified to resolve the issue
