        ### ðŸ¤– For Copilot Agent
        
        **Implementation Guidelines:**
        - Review the current participant lists in `src/backend/database.py`
        - For bulk operations, consider creating a script or using database operations
        - Validate all student emails exist and are in correct format
        - Check activity capacity limits before adding students
        - For moves between activities:
          1. Remove from source activity first
          2. Add to destination activity second
          3. Verify both operations succeeded
        - Update the `participants` arrays in `initial_activities` dictionary
        - Consider if this is a data-only change or requires new functionality
        - Test the changes are reflected correctly in the frontend
        
        **Acceptance Criteria:**
        - [ ] All specified student email addresses are validated
        - [ ] Requested changes are applied accurately to participant lists
