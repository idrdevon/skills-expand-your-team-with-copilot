        ### ðŸ¤– For Copilot Agent
        
        **Implementation Guidelines:**
        - Add the new activity to `src/backend/database.py` in the `initial_activities` dictionary
        - Follow the existing data structure with fields: `description`, `schedule`, `schedule_details`, `max_participants`, `participants`
        - The `schedule` field should be human-readable (e.g., "Mondays, 3:30 PM - 5:00 PM")
        - The `schedule_details` should contain structured data with `days` array, `start_time`, and `end_time`
        - Set `participants` to an empty list initially
        - Test the activity appears correctly in the frontend
        - Ensure the activity can be filtered and searched properly
        
        **Acceptance Criteria:**
        - [ ] Activity appears in the activities list on the main page
        - [ ] Activity details are displayed correctly (name, description, schedule, capacity)
        - [ ] Teachers can register students for the activity
        - [ ] Activity can be filtered by day and time
        - [ ] Activity shows correct capacity information
        - [ ] No existing functionality is broken
