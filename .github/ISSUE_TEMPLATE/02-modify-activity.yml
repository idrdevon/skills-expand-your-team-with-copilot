        **Implementation Guidelines:**
        - Locate the activity in `src/backend/database.py` in the `initial_activities` dictionary
        - Update only the fields that are specified to change
        - Preserve all existing data for unchanged fields
        - For schedule changes, update both `schedule` (human-readable) and `schedule_details` (structured data)
        - If changing maximum participants and current participants exceed new limit, preserve existing participants
        - Test all changes work correctly in the frontend
        - Ensure filtering and search still work after changes
        
        **Acceptance Criteria:**
        - [ ] Specified changes are applied correctly to the activity
        - [ ] Unchanged fields remain exactly the same
        - [ ] Activity displays correctly in the frontend with updated information
        - [ ] Current participants are preserved (unless maximum is reduced)
        - [ ] Activity filtering and search work with updated data
        - [ ] No other activities are accidentally modified
        - [ ] No existing functionality is broken
